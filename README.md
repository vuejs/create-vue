## Usage

To create a new Vue project using `create-vue`, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm create vue@latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> (`@latest` or `@legacy`) MUST NOT be omitted, otherwise `npm` may resolve to a cached and outdated version of the package.

Or, if you need to support IE11, you can create a Vue 2 project with:

```sh
npm create vue@legacy
```

> [!WARNING]  
> [Vue 2 Has Reached End of Life](https://v2.vuejs.org/eol/)

## Difference from Vue CLI

- Vite-Powered: Vue CLI is based on webpack, while `create-vue` is based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Vite supports most of the configured conventions found in Vue CLI projects out of the box, and provides a significantly better development experience due to its extremely fast startup and hot-module replacement speed. Learn more about why we recommend Vite over webpack [here](https://vite.dev/guide/why.html).

- Scaffolding Tool: Unlike Vue CLI, `create-vue` itself is just a scaffolding tool. It creates a pre-configured project based on the features you choose, and delegates the rest to Vite. Projects scaffolded this way can directly leverage the [Vite plugin ecosystem](https://vite.dev/plugins/) which is Rollup-compatible.
